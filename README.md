Files for Group 1 for Topics of Applied Operational Research 21/22 at the Univeristy of Edinburgh.

In order to replicate the model outlined in the 2013 article "Atomated Bed Assignments in a Complex and Dynamic Hospital Environment‚Äù by Thomas et.al, we first needed to generate data in relation to both the hospital itself as well as the patients that the hospital expects to see. 

In the Data Creations folder, you shall see the python code that we used to do generate such data. For the logic and reasonings behind this, please read Section 2 of the final report. 

For the models that we created to analyse how well patients are assigned to beds, please see the Model folder.
